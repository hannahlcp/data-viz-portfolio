# Data Visualisation using ggplot2
This repo is week 9 to week 11 of the QMUL Data Science and Coding module, using R. This content ranges from the basics of the grammar of graphics, gradually builds up ggplot2 code using a range and combination of geoms, implements the patchwork package, and explains how to 'tell a story' using data. Directories include datasets and the weekly worksheet. Code files are extensively commented to guide through the steps of generating the visualisations.


**Week 9:**
- The Grammar of Graphics - ggplot2
- Saving Plots - ggplot2::ggsave
- Continuous vs Categorial Variables
- Statistical Transformations
- Plotting Data Subsets - dplyr::filter and is.na
- Figure Labels - using the ggplot2 labs argument

**Week 11:**
- Summary Tables - using dplyr::group_by and dplyr::summarise
- Heatmaps - using ggplot2::geom_raster
- Changing Axes - including log scales, and the ggplot2 limits and breaks argument
- Highlighting Data Subsets 
- Manual Colour Scales - using RColourBrewer::brewer.pal
- Putting Together Plots - using patchwork and collecting guides
