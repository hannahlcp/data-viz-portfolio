# Data Visualisation using ggplot2
This repo is week 9 to week 11 of the QMUL Data Science and Coding module, using R. This content ranges from the basics of the grammar of graphics, gradually builds up ggplot2 code using a range and combination of geoms, implements the patchwork package, and explains how to 'tell a story' using data. Directories include datasets and the weekly worksheet. Code files are extensively commented to guide through the steps of generating the visualisations.
