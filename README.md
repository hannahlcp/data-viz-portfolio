# Data Visualisation in R


This repo is week 9 to week 11 of the Queen Mary University of London Data Science and Coding module, using R. The content ranges from the grammar of graphics, introduces and explains ggplot2, builds on a range and combination of geoms, implements the patchwork package, and explains how to 'tell a story' using data. The piece of data visualisation coursework is also included. 

Directories include datasets, and the code files are extensively commented to guide through the steps of generating visualisations. The instruction worksheets are available in the respective folders.

**Week 9:**
- The Grammar of Graphics - ggplot2
- Saving Plots - ggplot2::ggsave
- Continuous vs Categorial Variables
- Statistical Transformations
- Plotting Data Subsets - dplyr::filter and is.na
- Figure Labels - ggplot2::labs

**Week 10:**
- Annotating Data Points - ggplot2::geom_text
- Facets - ggplot2:: facet_wrap (takes a number of plots and 'wraps' them into a grid) and ggplot2::facet_grid (defined by row and column faceting variables)
- Patchwork
- Colours - covering discrete colour scales, continuous colour scales (including ggplot2 viridis scales) and NA values
- Themes

**Week 11:**
- Summary Tables - dplyr::group_by and dplyr::summarise
- Heatmaps - ggplot2::geom_raster
- Changing Axes - including log scales, and the ggplot2::limits and ggplot2::breaks 
- Highlighting Data Subsets 
- Manual Colour Scales - RColourBrewer::brewer.pal
- Putting Together Plots - patchwork and collecting guides

**Coursework:**

Instructions - make two data presentations based on 1) the World Malaria Report, and 2) the World Malaria Report and an external dataset.
